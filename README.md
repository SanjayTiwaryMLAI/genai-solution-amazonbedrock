# AI-Powered Document Analysis

This project provides a suite of solutions for analyzing documents (PDFs and images) using AI technology. Users can upload their documents, ask questions, and receive intelligent responses enhanced by various AI capabilities.

## Solutions

1. **PDF Analysis**
   - Upload multi-page PDF documents for analysis
   - Ask questions about the documents
   - AI enhancements:
     - Translate: Translate text to different languages
     - Comprehend: Perform entity detection and text analysis
     - Polly: Convert text to speech

2. **Image Analysis**
   - Upload images for analysis
   - Ask questions about the images
   - Images are analyzed using Amazon Textract for image analysis
   - AI enhancements:
     - Translate: Translate text to different languages
     - Comprehend: Perform entity detection and text analysis
     - Polly: Convert text to speech

3. **RAG with Kendra and Bedrock**
   - Ask questions, and responses are generated by retrieving relevant chunks from Amazon Kendra and summarized using Claude 2
   - Example: "What is ABDM?"

4. **RAG with OpenSearch and Bedrock**
   - Ask questions, and responses are generated by retrieving relevant chunks from OpenSearch and summarized using Claude 2
   - Example: "How did Amazon perform during COVID-19?"

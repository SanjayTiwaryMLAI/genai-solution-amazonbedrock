# Usecase- details

Here's a README file for the GitHub repository of the project you described:

# AI-Powered Document Analysis

This project provides a suite of solutions for analyzing documents (PDFs and images) using AI technology. Users can upload their documents, ask questions, and receive intelligent responses enhanced by various AI capabilities.

## Solutions

1. **PDF Analysis**
   - Upload multi-page PDF documents for analysis
   - Ask questions about the documents
   - AI enhancements:
     - Translate: Translate text to different languages
     - Comprehend: Perform entity detection and text analysis
     - Polly: Convert text to speech

2. **Image Analysis**
   - Upload images for analysis
   - Ask questions about the images
   - Images are analyzed using Amazon Textract for image analysis
   - AI enhancements:
     - Translate: Translate text to different languages
     - Comprehend: Perform entity detection and text analysis
     - Polly: Convert text to speech

3. **RAG with Kendra and Bedrock**
   - Ask questions, and responses are generated by retrieving relevant chunks from Amazon Kendra and summarized using Claude 2
   - Example: "What is ABDM?"

4. **RAG with OpenSearch and Bedrock**
   - Ask questions, and responses are generated by retrieving relevant chunks from OpenSearch and summarized using Claude 2
   - Example: "How did Amazon perform during COVID-19?"

5. **Claude 3**
   - Ask questions related to mathematics and probability
   - Provide images and text in the same query for analysis

## Getting Started


# Steps to use the application


Here's the rewritten version for a GitHub README file:

# GenAISolutions

This repository contains code for invoking a large language model (LLM) to process and analyze large documents.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Navigate to the project folder

```bash
cd GenAIsolutions
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .llmv
source .llmv/bin/activate
.llmv/bin/python
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Open a terminal and install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit application

To run the Streamlit application, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run WelcomePage.py --server.port 8080
```

### 5. Run the main script (alternative)

Alternatively, you can run the main script directly:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Usage

This project allows you to invoke a large language model to process and analyze large documents. The main functionality is provided by the `main.py` script, which you can run directly or through the Streamlit application.

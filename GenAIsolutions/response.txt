 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to provide detailed answers to all the questions asked. The documents provided discuss a product called "Chouk Connect" which aims to connect service providers with customers needing those services. It talks about features like user registration, order and payment tracking, customer support etc. 

However, without more information or documents related to the new idea asked about in the instructions (health record analysis using AI), I cannot provide specific details for things like idea origin, value proposition, MVP features, story map, revenue model etc. 

If more background information and documents are provided related to the health record analysis idea, I would be happy to provide a more thorough response. Some areas I could likely address:

- Target customers: patients, doctors/healthcare providers, insurance companies 
- Underserved needs: personalized health insights, predictive analytics, reducing administrative workload
- Value proposition: improved patient outcomes and experience, optimized operations and costs
- MVP features: upload/access health records, surface insights and recommendations, schedule appointments
- Risks: privacy, security, accuracy of recommendations

Please let me know if you can provide more context and documents around the health record analysis idea, and I will do my best to give a comprehensive response across all the requested areas.

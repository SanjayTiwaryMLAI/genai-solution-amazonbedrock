To implement the given database schema diagram in Python, we can create classes representing each table and define their attributes and relationships. Here's an example implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Group:
    def __init__(self, group_id: int, name: str):
        self.group_id = group_id
        self.name = name

class Student:
    def __init__(self, student_id: int, first_name: str, last_name: str, group_id: int):
        self.student_id = student_id
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.group_id = group_id

class Subject:
    def __init__(self, subject_id: int, title: str):
        self.subject_id = subject_id
        self.title = title

class Teacher:
    def __init__(self, teacher_id: int, first_name: str, last_name: str):
        self.teacher_id = teacher_id
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name

class SubjectTeacher:
    def __init__(self, subject_id: int, teacher_id: int, group_id: int):
        self.subject_id = subject_id
        self.teacher_id = teacher_id
        self.group_id = group_id

class Mark:
    def __init__(self, mark_id: int, student_id: int, subject_id: int, date: str, mark: int):
        self.mark_id = mark_id
        self.student_id = student_id
        self.subject_id = subject_id
        self.date = date
        self.mark = mark
```

In this implementation, each class represents a table in the database schema. The class attributes correspond to the columns in the respective table. The relationships between tables are represented through the use of foreign keys (e.g., `group_id` in the `Student` class, `subject_id` and `teacher_id` in the `SubjectTeacher` class).

You can create instances of these classes and use them to represent and manipulate data in your Python application. For example:

```python
# Create a group
group1 = Group(1, "Group A")

# Create students
student1 = Student(1, "John", "Doe", group1.group_id)
student2 = Student(2, "Jane", "Smith", group1.group_id)

# Create subjects
subject1 = Subject(1, "Mathematics")
subject2 = Subject(2, "English")

# Create teachers
teacher1 = Teacher(1, "Alice", "Johnson")
teacher2 = Teacher(2, "Bob", "Williams")

# Create subject-teacher assignments
subject_teacher1 = SubjectTeacher(subject1.subject_id, teacher1.teacher_id, group1.group_id)
subject_teacher2 = SubjectTeacher(subject2.subject_id, teacher2.teacher_id, group1.group_id)

# Create marks
mark1 = Mark(1, student1.student_id, subject1.subject_id, "2023-05-01", 85)
mark2 = Mark(2, student2.student_id, subject2.subject_id, "2023-05-02", 92)
```

This example demonstrates how to create instances of the classes and establish relationships between them. You can further extend this implementation by adding methods to perform various operations, such as retrieving data, updating data, or performing complex queries.

The image illustrates the architecture and workflow of an AWS-based system for generating responses to user questions. Here are the steps involved:

1. A user submits a question.
2. The question is received by an application or service (e.g., Streamlit Application).
3. The question is forwarded to Amazon API Gateway, which acts as a proxy for GenAI (REST APIs).
4. Amazon API Gateway triggers an AWS Lambda function (RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation).
5. The Lambda function interacts with BEDROCK Embedding, which is responsible for embedding documents.
6. The Lambda function also interacts with a SageMaker endpoint.
7. The AWS Lambda function processes the user question and generates a response.
8. The response is sent back through Amazon API Gateway to the application or service.
9. The application or service (e.g., Streamlit Application) displays the generated response to the user.

The system also involves the following AWS services:

- Amazon Cognito: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Provides a secure and isolated virtual network environment.
- Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS): Stores and manages the data required for the system.
- Amazon SageMaker Processing Job: Responsible for converting documents to embeddings.
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3): Stores the documents and other data required for the system.

The workflow involves both real-time processing of user queries and offline data ingestion processes.

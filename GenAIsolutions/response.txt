In the given chemical reaction between hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and iodine (I2) to produce hydrogen iodide (HI) and sulfur (S), the reducing and oxidizing agents can be identified based on the changes in oxidation states of the elements involved.

The correct answer is option c) Sulfur and iodine respectively.

In this redox reaction, sulfur is being oxidized from the -2 oxidation state in H2S to the 0 oxidation state in elemental sulfur (S). Therefore, sulfur acts as the reducing agent, donating electrons.

On the other hand, iodine is being reduced from the 0 oxidation state in elemental iodine (I2) to the -1 oxidation state in hydrogen iodide (HI). Therefore, iodine acts as the oxidizing agent, accepting electrons.

So, the reducing agent is sulfur, and the oxidizing agent is iodine in this redox reaction between hydrogen sulfide and iodine.

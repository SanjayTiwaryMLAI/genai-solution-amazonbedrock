For the first part (i), the correct answer is (b) kinetic energy to sound energy.

When a bell fixed on a cycle rings, the kinetic energy of the vibrating bell gets converted into sound energy that we hear as the ringing sound.

For the second part (ii), to find the minimum force required when a moment of 1 Nm is produced by turning a lever of length 0.2 m, we can use the formula:

Moment of force = Force Ã— Perpendicular distance

Rearranging, we get:
Force = Moment of force / Perpendicular distance
        = 1 Nm / 0.2 m
        = 5 N

Therefore, the correct answer for part (ii) is (a) 5 N.

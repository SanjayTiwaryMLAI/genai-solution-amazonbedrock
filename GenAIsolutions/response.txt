To solve this problem, I will:

1. Calculate the area of the rectangular piece of land using the given length and breadth.
2. Find the cost of the land using the area calculated in step 1 and the given cost per square meter.

Given information:
- The length of the rectangular piece of land is 500 m.
- The breadth of the rectangular piece of land is 300 m.
- The cost of the land is ₹ 10,000 per square meter (m²).

Step 1: Calculate the area of the rectangular piece of land.
Area of a rectangle = Length × Breadth
Area of the rectangular piece of land = 500 m × 300 m
Area of the rectangular piece of land = 150,000 square meters (m²)

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the land.
Cost of the land = Area of the land × Cost per square meter
Cost of the land = 150,000 m² × ₹ 10,000 per m²
Cost of the land = ₹ 1,500,000,000

Therefore, the area of the rectangular piece of land is 150,000 square meters, and the cost of the land is ₹ 1,500,000,000 (or 1.5 billion rupees) if 1 square meter of the land costs ₹ 10,000.

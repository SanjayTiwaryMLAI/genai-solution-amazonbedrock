For the first question (i), the correct answer is (b) kinetic energy to sound energy. When a bell fixed on a cycle rings, the kinetic energy of the vibrating bell gets converted to sound energy that we hear.

For the second question (ii), to find the minimum force required, we use the formula: Moment of force = Force x Perpendicular distance
Given:
Moment of force = 1 Nm
Perpendicular distance = Length of the lever (handle) = 0.2 m
Substituting in the formula:
1 Nm = Force x 0.2 m
Force = 1 Nm / 0.2 m
Force = 5 N

Therefore, the correct answer for the second question is (a) 5 N.
